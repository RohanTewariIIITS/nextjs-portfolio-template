  "detailedDescription": "Built a `production-grade` Android application to digitize Mid-Day Meal record keeping for government schools that traditionally rely on handwritten registers. The app replaces manual logs with a fully `offline-first`, structured, and `audit-compliant` system, enabling schools to capture daily data and automatically generate official monthly reports.\n\n🚩 **What problem it solves**\nSchools manually maintain attendance, meal counts, food grain usage, and fund records on paper, which:\n- consumes hours every month\n- causes calculation mistakes\n- makes audits difficult\n- fails in low-internet rural areas\n\nThis app provides a reliable offline digital alternative that mirrors government formats exactly while `automating calculations` and reporting.\n\n🛠️ **My Contributions**\n- `Designed and developed` the entire app `end-to-end` (architecture, database, UI, reporting pipeline)\n- Implemented `offline-first` data entry workflows using calendar-based daily logs\n- `Engineered` a `normalized Room database schema` for audit-safe persistence (school profile, daily entries, funds, grains, metadata)\n- Built a `PDF generation engine` that aggregates monthly data into multi-page government-style registers\n- Added `automatic computations` for balances, totals, and expenditures to eliminate manual math errors\n- Developed manual compliance modules for inspections and monthly checks with `validations`\n- Designed a `Material 3 UI` optimized for low-end devices and high readability for non-technical users\n- Applied `MVVM` + `Coroutines` for clean `separation of concerns` and `scalable` code structure\n\n⚙️ **Technical Highlights**\n- `100% offline` functionality\n- Structured local database with `relational modeling`\n- `Background report generation`\n- Large-form data handling\n- `Production-focused UX` for rural environments\n\n📈 **Impact**\n- Reduces reporting time from `hours → minutes`\n- `Minimizes human errors`\n- Improves `audit readiness` and transparency\n- Demonstrates `real-world Android engineering` beyond CRUD apps",
