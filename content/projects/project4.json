  "detailedDescription": "Built `HithoBus` - a unified bus tracking platform that integrates all major Indian government road transport services (UPSRTC, PBSRTC, HRSRTC, RJSRTC, and more) into a single `offline-capable` app. Unlike trains, government buses operate in a highly decentralized ecosystem with no uniform GPS mandate or data sharing, leaving passengers with long and uncertain wait times. This app solves that by providing `real-time tracking` even in rural, low-network areas through innovative `cell tower-based location inference`.\n\n🚩 **What problem it solves**\nGovernment bus passengers face critical challenges:\n- No standardized tracking system across state transport corporations\n- Long, uncertain waiting times with no arrival estimates\n- Limited internet connectivity in rural areas makes online tracking unreliable\n- Decentralized bus operations with no GPS mandate\n- Unlike trains, buses lack unified infrastructure for real-time location data\n\nHithoBus provides a reliable `offline-first` solution that works even without active internet by leveraging `cell tower proximity` and `crowdsourced GPS` data.\n\n🛠️ **My Contributions (Team Leader)**\n- `Led team of 4 developers` in `architecting` and building the complete tracking system\n- `Designed and implemented` the mobile UI using `Jetpack Compose` with `Material 3`\n- `Engineered` the core `offline tracking algorithm` using cell tower triangulation and route-aware tower matching\n- Implemented continuous GPS monitoring and cell tower detection using `TelephonyManager API` (supporting both modern TelephonyCallback and legacy PhoneStateListener for `backward compatibility`)\n- Built `dual-mode tracking`: Cell tower-based (offline) + GPS crowdsourcing (online)\n- Developed `foreground services` with persistent notifications for `background location tracking`\n- Integrated `Fused Location Provider` for optimized `battery-efficient` GPS updates (15-second polling interval)\n- Created `Room database schema` for local storage of tower metadata and route mappings\n- Implemented `Retrofit`-based `REST API` client with polling mechanism for server communication\n- Applied `MVVM` + `Hilt DI` architecture with `Kotlin Coroutines/Flow` for `reactive` location streams\n- Coordinated with backend team for `API design` and `MongoDB` integration\n\n⚙️ **Technical Highlights**\n**Offline Cell Tower Tracking:**\n- Fetches route data from `GeoJSON` files via `Node.js` backend\n- Maintains towers.json database of cell towers along bus routes\n- Uses `TelephonyManager` to detect currently connected cell tower\n- Compares detected tower with `Room database` to resolve approximate bus location\n- If tower not found → prompts user to contribute GPS data (`crowdsourcing`)\n\n**GPS Crowdsourcing System:**\n- Users inside buses share `real-time location` via `Fused Location Provider`\n- Location updates every 15 seconds (`battery-optimized`)\n- Data sent to server via `Retrofit` with polling mechanism\n- Server calculates nearest bus stop and `arrival estimates`\n- Outside users fetch live location from crowdsourced GPS pool\n\n**Android Services Implementation:**\n- `Foreground services` with persistent notifications (system compliance)\n- `Lifecycle-aware` tracking jobs with `structured concurrency`\n- Automatic cancellation and restart of tracking loops\n- Speed calculation and `ETA estimation`\n- Support for both modern Android APIs (31+) and `legacy versions`\n\n**Full-Stack Integration:**\n- `MongoDB` backend for `scalable` route and tower storage\n- `Python` scripts (Pandas, GeoPandas) for route processing\n- `Express REST APIs` for location polling and route fetching\n- `Google Maps SDK` for route visualization\n\n📈 **Impact**\n- Enables bus tracking in `rural and low-network areas` where online solutions fail\n- Provides `unified platform` for multiple state transport corporations\n- Reduces passenger wait time uncertainty with `ETA calculations`\n- `Crowdsourcing model` continuously improves tower database coverage\n- Demonstrates `advanced Android system integration` (telephony, location, services)\n- `Battery-efficient` design suitable for extended usage\n- `Real-world solution` addressing India's decentralized bus infrastructure challenge",
